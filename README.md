TagBrowse
=========
A very simple and slim file browser for android which allows to tag each file.

These tags can then help to provide a more convenient and efficient classification of files.


Basic functionality

The View is subdivided into two areas:
* top: show files
* bottom: show tags

Short touch: directory -> show content, file -> open if possible

Long touch: open 'add tag' dialog

touch on tag on the bottom: show all files having this tag

ActionBar: search for tags
